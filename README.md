# Data Science Techinspire's Loan Analysis : Project Overview
- Created multiple charts,graphs,boxplots,etc. in order to understand how to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers.
- Worked on a dataset consisting of 39717 rows of data for 111 different features.
- Performed univariate analysis as well as multivariate analysis on various features to understand the importance of every feature.
- Used EDA to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default rate.Thus,helped the company in understanding the driving factors (or
driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.

# Code and Resources Used
-Python Version: 3.6.0
-Packages: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

# Data Cleaning
## After reading the data, I needed to clean it up so that it was usable for our data analysis. I made the following changes and created the following variables:
- Checked whether we have missing data for various cloumns.
- Since,many columns had 33%,65% and even 100% missing values,I deleted those columns as they had no impact in deciding the default.
